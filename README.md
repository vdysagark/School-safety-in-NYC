# School-safety-in-NYC

As a parent, we look for certain qualities while choosing the best school for our children. For some, it begins by buying or renting in a great school district. Other things we consider are students to teachersâ€™ ratio, size of the class, special programs, extracurricular activities and after school programs. There are many resources available to learn about such factors to help with decision making. During my research to find the best school that fit our needs, one such aspect that piqued my curiosity is 'School safety'. In recent years there is a sharp rise in mass shootings, especially in schools. While there are many resources citing which neighborhoods are safe in the New York City area, there are no clear numbers available for schools in particular. Being the cultural, financial and media capital of the world, how safe are the public schools in NYC? This study focuses on finding as much information as possible on school safety. I will also be trying to build a machine learning model with the available school safety data.
